Hi, welcome to my technical test for the Java developer position.

In this file you can find the instructions to execute successfully the spring boot service, and React front created for the challenge.

As the first step, you need to download and install docker https://www.docker.com/.
When it's ready you can clone or download the project.

Now, please open a new PowerShell or cmd in the root folder of the project.

Once here, please execute the next command docker-compose up --build

This command will build and execute both projects (Spring boot and React).

When the command finished the process, you can access to the solution in this URL http://localhost:3000

Now you can try the application.

When using the application, you will find  some alerts with the status code of the Dummy API, it's because that  API is not available all the time, and you can verify it accessing directly into the URL's proposed for the exercise.

Here you can see some of the main errors of the Dummy API

The good news is that these errors are handled in the Spring boot app.

I hope you like the solution, and of course will be totally open to solve any questions about it.

Thank you for this opportunity.

Best Regards, Julián Arévalo
